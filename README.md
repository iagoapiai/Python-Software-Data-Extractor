## Python Software Data Extractor
Python script that scrapes software using the pyautogui library and stores the collected information in an xlsx file, everything is automated, just have the software open and run the script!

## :warning: Prerequisites

- [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

- [OpenPyXl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

- [Time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html)

- [Pyperclip](https://pyperclip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## WHAT THE SCRIPT DO:
- 1° Click on the data field;
- 2° Press tab and then enter to enter another tab for data collection;
- 3° Click on the fields to collect data and store it within a workbook;
- 4° Repeat the process, switching tabs to collect other data.

You can change the sleep time to increase data capture speed!

NOTE: If your machine has low performance, do not reduce the sleep time
